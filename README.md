Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Suraj, a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.

ðŸ’¼ Most recently, I was working on some exciting projects at [Wish](https://www.wish.com) and [OpsLevel](https://www.opslevel.com).

ðŸ’† In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball, cooking (or at least, attempting to) and having a good time with my friends.

Feel free to [reach out](mailto:sr3gupta@uwaterloo.ca) if you'd like to chat ðŸ™‚
