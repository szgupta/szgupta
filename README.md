Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Suraj, a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.

ðŸ’¼ In the past, I've worked on some exciting projects at [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/company/) (see [sfc-gh-sgupta](https://github.com/sfc-gh-sgupta)), [Wish](https://www.wish.com) and [OpsLevel](https://www.opslevel.com).

ðŸ’† In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball, cooking (or at least, attempting to) and having a good time with my friends.

Feel free to [reach out](mailto:sr3gupta@uwaterloo.ca) if you'd like to chat ðŸ™‚
